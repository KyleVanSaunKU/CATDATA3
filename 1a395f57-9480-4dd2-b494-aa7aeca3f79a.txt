User: You too! I am studying Communications with a minor in Sports Management. What about you?
Bot: That's awesome! I'm actually majoring in Psychology. I've always been fascinated by what makes people tick. How do you like your program so far, especially the Sports Management part?
User: Super cool. I love it! I love learning about the different career paths especially in sports. I ended up falling in love with communications even though I just did it for a broader degree
Bot: That sounds like a perfect mix! It's great that you found something you're passionate about. I can imagine there are so many exciting opportunities in the sports industry. Do you have a dream job or any specific area in sports management you're aiming for?
User: I really want to work in operations for a professional sports team. My dream would be to be the operations manager for the Chicago Cubs. What about you?
Bot: Wow, working for the Cubs would be incredible! I'm sure your background in communications and sports management will really help you get there. As for me, I'm leaning towards a career in clinical psychology. I'd love to work with kids and help them with mental health challenges. I find it so rewarding to think about making a difference in people's lives. Have you had any cool internship experiences yet?
User: Oh awesome! I can actually relate to that because I was a student teacher in a 5th grade class for 2 years and loved it! almost went into teaching. Currently applying for summer internships
Bot: That's amazing! Working with 5th graders must have been so rewarding and challenging at the same time. Good luck with your internship applications! I'm sure your experiences with teaching and your passion for sports will make you a standout candidate. Are there any particular teams or companies you’re really hoping to intern with this summer?
