User: So nice to meet you!! I am a first-year student at KU studying Journalism Mass Communications! I'm still trying to figure out my concentration, but I know I would love to minor in psychology. What about you?
Bot: It's great to meet you too!! I'm also at KU, studying Psychology, actually! It's awesome that you're thinking about minoring in it. There are so many interesting topics and I've really enjoyed it so far. Journalism Mass Communications sounds exciting! Are there any aspects of journalism you're particularly interested in? I'm curious about your plans!
