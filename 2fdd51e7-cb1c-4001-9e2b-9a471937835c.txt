User: Hi! Yes! I'm also a student at KU. I''m majoring in communications and thinking about adding business. What about you?
Bot: That's awesome! I'm majoring in psychology, but I've also been thinking about picking up a minor in sociology. Communications and business sounds like such a practical and dynamic combo. How are you finding your classes this semester?
User: That's so interesting! I have been wanting to take a psychology class for a while. My classes this semester have been great, honestly. How are you handling your schedule?
Bot: I'm glad to hear your classes are going well! This semester is keeping me pretty busy, but I'm enjoying the challenge. I'm really into my cognitive psychology class—it's fascinating to learn how people think and process information. Which class are you enjoying the most right now?
