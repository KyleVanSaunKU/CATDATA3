No not really I do want to take the lab tho it sounds interesting to me

Bot: Absolutely, it really is! There's so much to discover and explore. Do you have any plans on what you want to do after you finish your degree? Maybe something in healthcare or research?
User: I either want to go to medical school and do orthopedic surgery or go into radiology 
Bot: Those are both amazing paths! Orthopedic surgery and radiology are both such vital fields. Do you have a preference between them, or are you still weighing the options?
