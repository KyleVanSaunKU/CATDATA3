Bot: Got it! Sometimes it's just the little things, right? What’s been annoying you guys lately?
User: eveythkmg, what annoys you
Bot: Honestly, for me it's when things get super busy and I can't find time for myself. It gets overwhelming. How do you usually deal with all the chaos?

Bot: Fair enough. Sometimes it’s just hard to handle. Maybe taking small breaks when you can might help? What do you usually do to unwind, though?
