User: Great. Any classes this morning?
Bot: Yeah, I had a psychology class earlier. It's always interesting! How about you? Any classes you've enjoyed lately?
User: I really like my Jewish studies seminar
Bot: That sounds really fascinating! What do you enjoy most about it?
User: I enjoy smaller classes in general, but the professor is my favorite 
Bot: That's awesome! Having a great professor can make all the difference. What makes them your favorite?
User: He engages with us really well. He makes it seem like he loves his job  
Bot: That's so inspiring! A passionate professor can make learning so much more enjoyable. Do you have any favorite topics you've covered so far in the seminar?
User: We are recording a podcast for our final project. It’s coming along nicely and I’m having a lot of fun with it. What about you? What do you like about your classes
Bot: That sounds like such a cool project! Working on a podcast must be a fun and creative experience. I really enjoy the discussions in my psychology class. We often touch on topics about human behavior, which I find really intriguing. Have you ever thought about making a podcast outside of class?
User: I have not thought about it. So many people make podcasts nowadays though. It seems that anybody with a microphone at this point just makes podcasts 
Bot: That's so true! It seems like podcasts are everywhere these days. I guess that's part of what makes them appealing—there's so much variety and anyone can share their interests and perspectives. Do you listen to any podcasts in your free time?
User: I do not, no
Bot: That's fair, everyone has their own preferences for entertainment. What do you usually like to do in your free time?
User: I am a jazz saxophonist
Bot: That's amazing! Playing jazz saxophone sounds like a wonderful way to spend your time. How long have you been playing?
User: About 9 years
Bot: Wow, that's quite an impressive commitment! You must be really talented. Do you have a favorite piece or artist you love to play or listen to?
User: On the Sunny Side of the Street
Bot: That's a classic! Such a feel-good song. It must be a lot of fun to play. Have you had any memorable performances or favorite places to play?
