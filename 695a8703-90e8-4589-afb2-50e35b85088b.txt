User: It's actually somewhat new to me. My interest really started from watching shows that have to do with the law, and it has just been something I have found interesting since I started watching shows about law. What got you into psychology?
Bot: That's so cool how TV shows sparked your interest! For me, my interest in psychology started in high school when I took an introductory course. I loved learning about different theories and how they apply to everyday life. Plus, I was always curious about why people do what they do. Do you have a favorite law-themed show you'd recommend?
