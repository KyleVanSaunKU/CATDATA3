User: no not really do u have a favortite project or class that you have done yet
Bot: I’d say one of my favorite classes has been cognitive psychology. We did this project on memory and how different techniques like visualization can improve it. It was pretty eye-opening. Is there any particular aspect of information systems you've found challenging or that stands out to you?
