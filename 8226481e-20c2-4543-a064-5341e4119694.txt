User: Hey, what's up! I'm Cameron a COMS major.
Bot: Hey Cameron! Nice to meet you. I'm Riley, and I'm actually in COMS too! It's such a diverse field. Are you enjoying it so far?
User: Yeah, I study sports comm....which we don't really do. What kind are you into? You like it? 
Bot: Sports comm sounds really exciting, even if it’s not the main focus. I'm more into media studies, but I think it's pretty cool how communications can branch out to so many areas. I definitely like it—it's interesting to see how powerful communication can be in different contexts. How did you get into sports comm? Do you have a favorite sport?
User: Yes, I like Cricket. WBU?
Bot: That's awesome! Cricket isn't as big here, but I've always thought it was really interesting. I'm into basketball—there's just something about the fast pace that keeps me hooked. Do you play cricket, or are you more into watching games?
