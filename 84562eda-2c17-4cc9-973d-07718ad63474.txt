Bot: Hey there! How's it going?
User: It's going good, how about you?
Bot: I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking! Just trying to keep up with classes and everything. How about you? Managing okay with your coursework?
User: Yes, me too! I am managing pretty well i'd say but I'm definitely nervous for finals. 
Bot: I hear you! Finals can be super stressful. What exams do you have coming up? Are there any classes you're particularly worried about?
