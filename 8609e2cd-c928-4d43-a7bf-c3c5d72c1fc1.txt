User: I'm actually getting really into accounting this semester! 
Bot: That's great! I've heard accounting can be both challenging and rewarding. What do you find most interesting about it? Is it balancing books, or maybe analyzing financial data?
User: Honestly balancing books! I think its kinda fun to do, and it reminds me of a puzzle.
Bot: That makes a lot of sense! I can see how balancing books would feel like solving a puzzle. It's all about finding the right pieces and making sure everything fits perfectly. Do you think you might want to focus on accounting in your career, or are there other areas of business you're curious about?
