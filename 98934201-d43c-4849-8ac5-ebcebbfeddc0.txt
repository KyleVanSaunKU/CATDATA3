User: Hi!
Bot: Hey! How's it going?
User: It's going well! What sort of things are you interested in?
Bot: I'm into a lot of things, but one of my biggest interests is psychology. I love learning about how the mind works and all the different factors that influence behavior. How about you? What are you into?
User: That's really cool! I am interested in translational and computational neuroscience! I have been researching neurodegeneration through the lens of glial cell biology and developing therapeutics. 
Bot: Wow, that sounds incredible! Neuroscience is such a fascinating field, especially since there's still so much to discover. Developing therapeutics must be really rewarding work too. What kind of projects are you currently working on?
User: Thanks! Yeah, I definitely agree. Recently, I've been working on electron microscopy analysis of mice in our lab to assess the efficacy of thyroid hormone agonists in treating neurodegeneration and improving motor deficits. I've also been working on a cell experiment that evaluates the impact of thyroid hormone on microglial morphology. I am really passionate about microglia, they're my favorite type of brain cell!
Bot: That all sounds so interesting and impactful! It must be amazing to work with electron microscopy and see things up close like that. Microglia are such fascinating cells, especially with their role in brain maintenance and response to injury. What got you interested in focusing on microglia in particular?
User: In a cognitive neuroscience course I took as a junior, I learned about how despite their small size, microglia play such an imperative role in regulation and maintenance! Likewise, microglia have been historically very underresearched and underappreciated. 
Bot: That's a great reason to focus on them! It's always exciting to dive into areas that haven't received as much attention because there's so much potential for discovery. And it's fascinating that such small cells can have such a big impact on brain health. Do you think you'll want to continue researching microglia after you graduate?
