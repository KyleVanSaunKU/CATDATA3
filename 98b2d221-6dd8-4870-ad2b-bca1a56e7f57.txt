User: Hi, how has your day been?
Bot: Hey! My day's been pretty chill, thanks for asking. I had a couple of classes earlier, and now I'm just catching up on some reading for a history course. How's your day going so far?
User: Mine has been good as well! It was nice out today so I was able to go for a walk before my one class and since that I have been cleaning up my dorm and catching up on work. 
Bot: That's awesome! It really was a perfect day for a walk. Which class did you have today? Cleaning and catching up on work sounds productiveâ€”I'm still working on getting through my to-do list. What kind of stuff do you have to catch up on?
