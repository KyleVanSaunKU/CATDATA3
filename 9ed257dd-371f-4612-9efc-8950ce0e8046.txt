Bot: That's cool! I'm guessing COMS is pretty interesting. As for pizza, always a great choice. Any favorite toppings?
User: caramlized onions 
Bot: Oh, that's a tasty choice! Caramelized onions add so much flavor. Do you usually go for a specific type of pizza or mix it up?
User: both, depends on my mood 
Bot: That makes sense, it's nice to have options. Do you have a favorite pizza place in town, or do you like trying different spots?
User: both 
Bot: Cool, it's fun exploring different places while having a go-to spot. Do you and your boyfriend try to find new spots when you go out to eat, or do you tend to stick to favorites?
User: both again , just depends what we are wanitng to do 
Bot: That sounds like a good approachâ€”keeps things interesting but also comforting. Do you guys ever get adventurous with trying new foods, or are you more about the classic options?
