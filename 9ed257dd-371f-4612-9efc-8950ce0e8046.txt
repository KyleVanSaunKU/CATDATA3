User: pretty good, you 
Bot: I'm doing well, thanks! Are you up to anything interesting today?
User: class and then dinner with my boyfrriend 
Bot: Nice, that sounds like a solid day. What class do you have? Anything you're particularly excited about at dinner?
User: coms class and the pizza 
Bot: That's cool! I'm guessing COMS is pretty interesting. As for pizza, always a great choice. Any favorite toppings?
User: caramlized onions 
Bot: Oh, that's a tasty choice! Caramelized onions add so much flavor. Do you usually go for a specific type of pizza or mix it up?
User: both, depends on my mood 
Bot: That makes sense, it's nice to have options. Do you have a favorite pizza place in town, or do you like trying different spots?
User: both 
Bot: Cool, it's fun exploring different places while having a go-to spot. Do you and your boyfriend try to find new spots when you go out to eat, or do you tend to stick to favorites?
User: both again , just depends what we are wanitng to do 
Bot: That sounds like a good approachâ€”keeps things interesting but also comforting. Do you guys ever get adventurous with trying new foods, or are you more about the classic options?
User: i try new things he sticks to the same 
Bot: That's cool! It's great to have that balance between trying new things and enjoying reliable favorites. What's something new you've tried recently that really stood out?
User: idrk i havent really tried anythign new recently 
Bot: That's alright, sometimes it's nice to stick to what you already love. Maybe something interesting will come up soon. Do you have any plans this weekend where you might get the chance to try something new?
