Bot: Nice, that sounds like a solid day. What class do you have? Anything you're particularly excited about at dinner?
User: coms class and the pizza 
Bot: That's cool! I'm guessing COMS is pretty interesting. As for pizza, always a great choice. Any favorite toppings?
User: caramlized onions 
Bot: Oh, that's a tasty choice! Caramelized onions add so much flavor. Do you usually go for a specific type of pizza or mix it up?
User: both, depends on my mood 
Bot: That makes sense, it's nice to have options. Do you have a favorite pizza place in town, or do you like trying different spots?
