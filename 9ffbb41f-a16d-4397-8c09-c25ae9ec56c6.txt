User: Hi, my participant ID is: 4597 adn yes I am also a student at KU
Bot: Nice to meet you! What are you studying at KU? I'm curious to hear all about your major or any cool classes you're taking.
User: I study Communications with a business minor, I am taking business and communication classes, and I have writing electives.
Bot: That sounds like a great combination! I’ve heard that having a business minor can really complement a Communications major. How are you finding the writing electives? Do you have a favorite class so far?
