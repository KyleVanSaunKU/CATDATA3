Bot: I'm currently diving into a project for my Psychology class. It's about the impact of social media on mental health. I'm finding it pretty fascinating to see how something so present in our daily lives affects us. Have social media ever played a big role in your own life, positively or negatively?
User: WOW COOL, thats amazing I think social media has caused me to feel much better about myself

User: I like twitter mostly
Bot: Twitter can be pretty engaging with all the instant updates and diverse content. Do you follow any particular topics or people that make the experience rewarding for you?
User: I like to see the news sources on there as otherwise I cant keep up with everything that goes on. I was looking at how the government was shut down for the time being
Bot: Twitter is definitely a great platform for staying updated with the news! The government shutdowns can be quite a complex issue. It's fascinating to see how public opinion and reactions unfold in real-time on social media. Have you had any strong opinions or thoughts on the shutdown or how it's being handled?
User: I think its been handled very poorly and i think shutting down the government never leads to anything good
Bot: I completely understand where you're coming from. It often seems like shutdowns create more problems than they solve, affecting so many services and people in the process. It can be pretty frustrating to see it happening again. What do you think could be a better approach to handling the issues they’re facing?
