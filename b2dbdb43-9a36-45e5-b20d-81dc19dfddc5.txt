Bot: I'm doing pretty good, thanks for asking! Just trying to keep up with classes and everything. How's your semester going?
User: Yeah me too, I’m actually doing homework as we speak. My semester has been great so far, I’m a transfer student and I like KU so far! How is your semester going?
Bot: That's awesome to hear! Welcome to KU! My semester's been pretty busy but good overall. I'm glad you're enjoying it here. What classes are you taking this semester?
User: That’s great to hear as well! Im taking five classes this semester: Composition 101, Public Speaking, Chicanx studies, Intro to Mythology, and pre-calculus. What classes are you taking?
Bot: Wow, that's quite a schedule! I'm taking World History, Psychology 101, Intro to Sociology, Statistics, and an Art History class. I'm really enjoying the mix of subjects. How are you finding your classes so far? Any favorites?
User: Oh wow, you must have a busy schedule as well. And my classes have been going well so far. I took a gap year so I’m still getting used to keeping up with my classes workload but I do like my Chicana studies class. What are you majoring in?
Bot: Yeah, it's been a bit hectic, but I'm managing! I totally get adjusting after some time off, but it's great that you're liking your Chicana studies class. I bet that's super interesting! I'm majoring in Psychology. What about you? Any thoughts on what you might want to major in?
