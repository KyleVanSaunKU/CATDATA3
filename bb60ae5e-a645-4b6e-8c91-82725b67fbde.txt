User: Nice to meet you too ! Yes I am, my major is architecture, how about you?
Bot: That's awesome! I'm studying psychology. I've always found architecture fascinating though. What drew you to architecture?
User: My grandpa did it when he was young and he seemed to love it and I loved watching him love it.
Bot: That's such a cool way to get into architecture! It's amazing how passions can be passed through generations. Do you have a favorite type of building or style that you're particularly interested in?
