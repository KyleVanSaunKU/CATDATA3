User: Hello, how are you?
Bot: Hey! I'm doing pretty well, just busy with classes. How about you? How's your day going?
User: Good! My day is going well; I knocked out some laundry this morning and I am excited to play pickleball later!
Bot: That sounds like a productive morning! Pickleball seems like so much fun. I've been wanting to try it out. How long have you been playing?
User: I just started playing a few months ago and I would definitely recommend it@
Bot: That’s awesome! I’ve heard it’s pretty easy to pick up. Do you usually play with friends, or is it part of a club or class here at KU?
User: It is really easy to pick up! I play with friends and in a class here at KU

Bot: That sounds like a great way to meet people and stay active. How's the class? Do you learn a lot of new techniques, or is it more about just enjoying the game?
User: It definitely is! The class is more about just enjoying the game but me and my friend have learned a lot of new techniques by watching Tik Toks about pickleball
Bot: Nice, TikTok is such a good resource for picking up tips and tricks! Have you tried any of the new techniques in your games? Any success stories?
User: Yes I have and I have won a lot2
Bot: That's awesome! Winning must feel so satisfying, especially after trying out new techniques. Do you have a favorite move or strategy that you like to use in your matches?
User: I like attacking the best. This is easiest when the ball comes in over your head and you smash it down really fast on the other side\
Bot: That sounds intense! It must be such a rush when you execute that move perfectly. Have you had any memorable moments on the court when you made that play?
User: yes but lets change the subject
Bot: Of course! What else have you been up to lately, anything fun or interesting?
