Bot: Hey! How's it going?
User: Its going good, how are you doing?
Bot: I'm doing pretty well, thanks! Just the usual student life, you know. Have you been up to anything fun lately?
User: Yes I have! I recently went on a ski trip in Colorado over spring break
Bot: That sounds amazing! Iâ€™ve always wanted to go skiing in Colorado. How was it? Did you hit the slopes hard?
User: I've never went skiing before so it was definitely a learning experience but I did have fun.
Bot: That's awesome you gave it a shot! I've heard skiing can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's so much fun. Did you take any lessons or just wing it?
User: I just winged it but I had help from friends that are familiar with skiing
Bot: Nice! Friends can be the best instructors sometimes. Did you have any epic wipeouts, or did you manage to stay on your feet most of the time?
