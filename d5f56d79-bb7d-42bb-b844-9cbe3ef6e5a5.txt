Bot: Hey there! How's it going?
User: Pretty good. How about you?
Bot: I'm doing well, thanks! Just trying to keep up with everything this semester. What have you been up to lately?
User: Yeah pretty much same. I have been studying for a bunch of midterms coming up, but I am excited for summer.
Bot: Oh, I hear you! Midterms can be so stressful. But summer is definitely something to look forward to. Do you have any plans for the summer yet, or are you just ready for a break?
