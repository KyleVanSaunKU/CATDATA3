User: Hello
Bot: Hey there! How's it going?
User: Pretty good. How about you?
Bot: I'm doing well, thanks! Just trying to keep up with everything this semester. What have you been up to lately?
User: Yeah pretty much same. I have been studying for a bunch of midterms coming up, but I am excited for summer.
Bot: Oh, I hear you! Midterms can be so stressful. But summer is definitely something to look forward to. Do you have any plans for the summer yet, or are you just ready for a break?
User: I have a family trip planned right after school gets out, but then I will be ready to just relax at home. Do you have any plans for the summer you are looking forward to. 
Bot: That sounds like a nice balance between adventure and chill time! I’m planning on taking a road trip with some friends to the Rocky Mountains. After that, I'll probably spend some time working and catching up on some hobbies. What’s your family trip going to be like?
User: Nice that sounds like fun. We are flying into Las Vegas and then visiting a couple national parks.
Bot: That sounds awesome! The national parks around there are incredible. Do you know which parks you’re going to visit? I’ve heard Zion and the Grand Canyon are must-sees.
User: I have already been to the Grand Canyon so we are not going there but I think we are planning to go to Zion.
Bot: Zion should be amazing! I’ve seen tons of pictures, and it looks like such a stunning place with all those canyons and the crazy rock formations. Are you planning on doing some hiking while you're there?
User: Yeah, it seems like a lot of stuff you do at national parks is walk around, so I am sure we will be doing some sort of hiking while we are there.
Bot: Haha, true that! But I bet the views will make it all worth it. Plus, it’s always nice to disconnect and just enjoy nature. Do you like hiking, or is it just something you do because of your family trips?
