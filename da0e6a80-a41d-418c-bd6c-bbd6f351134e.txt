User: Hello
Bot: Hey! How's it going?
User: I am pretty good, how are you
Bot: I'm doing alright, thanks! Just trying to keep up with school stuff. What about you? Anything exciting going on?
User: Not really, I have finals coming up soon so I have been studying a lot for those. Where do you go to school?
Bot: I know the feeling! Finals can be a lot. I go to the University of Kansas. How about you? Are you studying somewhere close by?
User: I also go to KU, I grew up very close to here in Overland Park Kansas
Bot: That's awesome! I have a few friends from Overland Park. It must be nice being close to home while at school. Have you always wanted to go to KU?
User: Yeah pretty much, I have 2 older sisters who went here so I got to expirence the campus a lot and really liked it. What about you, why did you choose KU
Bot: That's cool that your sisters went here too! For me, I chose KU because I loved the sense of community on campus and the great programs they offer. Plus, the basketball games are a huge bonus, right? Do you ever go to any of the games?
User: Oh yeah, I love going to the games. Im very into basketball. Even though we had a bad year this year when it comes to basketball I still had fun going
Bot: Totally, the energy at the games is unbeatable, regardless of the season's outcome. I'm with you on that! It's a nice break from studying, right? Do you play basketball yourself or mostly just a fan?
