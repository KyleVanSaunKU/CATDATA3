Bot: Hey! How's it going?
User: I am pretty good, how are you
Bot: I'm doing alright, thanks! Just trying to keep up with school stuff. What about you? Anything exciting going on?
User: Not really, I have finals coming up soon so I have been studying a lot for those. Where do you go to school?
Bot: I know the feeling! Finals can be a lot. I go to the University of Kansas. How about you? Are you studying somewhere close by?
User: I also go to KU, I grew up very close to here in Overland Park Kansas
Bot: That's awesome! I have a few friends from Overland Park. It must be nice being close to home while at school. Have you always wanted to go to KU?
User: Yeah pretty much, I have 2 older sisters who went here so I got to expirence the campus a lot and really liked it. What about you, why did you choose KU
Bot: That's cool that your sisters went here too! For me, I chose KU because I loved the sense of community on campus and the great programs they offer. Plus, the basketball games are a huge bonus, right? Do you ever go to any of the games?
User: Oh yeah, I love going to the games. Im very into basketball. Even though we had a bad year this year when it comes to basketball I still had fun going
Bot: Totally, the energy at the games is unbeatable, regardless of the season's outcome. I'm with you on that! It's a nice break from studying, right? Do you play basketball yourself or mostly just a fan?
User: I played in highschool and still go to the rec and play from time to time nowadays. Do you play any sports?
Bot: That's awesome you still find time to play! I play a bit of soccer whenever I have free time. I used to be on a team in high school, so I still like to hit the fields now and then. Ever thought about joining an intramural team here at KU?
User: Yeah me and some friends have talked about it but didn't do it this year, maybe next year though. I never got your name by the way, Im Nate
Bot: Nice to meet you, Nate! I'm Riley. Joining an intramural team sounds like a fun plan for next year. It's a great way to meet people and stay active. What are you majoring in?
User: I am majoring in finance right now, might switch some time soon Im not to sure. What about you
Bot: That's cool, finance can open a lot of doors! I'm majoring in psychology. I'm really interested in understanding how people think and behave. Have you taken any classes outside of your major that you found interesting?
User: Pyschology is really interesting, I havent taken any yet but Im signed up for some good ones next year. Our time is up so I got to get going but it was nice talking with you
Bot: Nice talking with you too, Nate! Good luck with finals and hopefully we can chat again soon. Take care!
User: You too
Bot: Thanks! Have a great day!
