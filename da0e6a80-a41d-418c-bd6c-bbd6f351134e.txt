Bot: Hey! How's it going?
User: I am pretty good, how are you
Bot: I'm doing alright, thanks! Just trying to keep up with school stuff. What about you? Anything exciting going on?
User: Not really, I have finals coming up soon so I have been studying a lot for those. Where do you go to school?
Bot: I know the feeling! Finals can be a lot. I go to the University of Kansas. How about you? Are you studying somewhere close by?
User: I also go to KU, I grew up very close to here in Overland Park Kansas
Bot: That's awesome! I have a few friends from Overland Park. It must be nice being close to home while at school. Have you always wanted to go to KU?
