Bot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! Just trying to get through another busy week at KU. Are you up to anything interesting today?
User: Trying to get through this week too. I probably will just nap after I finish my hw
Bot: Sounds like a solid plan! Naps are the best, especially after tackling homework. What classes are you working on this week? Any favorites or ones giving you a hard time?
