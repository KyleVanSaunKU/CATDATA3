User: I am studying sports management with a minor in business. How about yourself? Are you enjoying your major so far?

User: Thats so cool! I am looking into playing professional volleyball after college as I am on the volleyball team here on KU. If that plan doesn't go according, I would love to go home to Indiana and work for a professional sports team like the Fever or the Pacers
Bot: That's amazing! Being on the KU volleyball team must be such a rewarding experience. Playing professionally sounds like an exciting path, and working for a team would be an incredible opportunity too. How's the season going for you so far?
User: The season is going great so far and I am loving my teammates? Are you apart of anything at KU that you are enjoying? What do you do in your free time?
Bot: I'm glad to hear your season is going well and that you have such great teammates! I'm part of the psychology club here at KU, and it's been a great way to meet people who share similar interests. In my free time, I love exploring the local coffee shops and catching up on my favorite TV shows. What about you? Do you have any favorite places in Lawrence or hobbies you enjoy?
User: I love that! I love going on Mass street or drawing. i am very artistic and find it to be a nice stress reliever. I love to crotchet too. Where are you from?
Bot: Mass Street is such a fun spot! It's great that you have creative outlets like drawing and crocheting to relax. I'm originally from St. Louis, but I've really come to love Lawrence. How about you—what's your favorite thing about Indiana?
User: I love my community at home. I went to a catholic high school where I have a really tight community that I share amazing memories with
Bot: That sounds wonderful! Having a supportive community makes such a big difference. I bet those high school memories are really special to you. Do you get to visit often, or are your visits mostly during breaks?
