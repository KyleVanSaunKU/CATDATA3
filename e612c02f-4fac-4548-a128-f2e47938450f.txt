Bot: Nice to meet you! What are you studying at the University of Kansas?
User: I am studying sports management with a minor in business. How about yourself? Are you enjoying your major so far?
Bot: That's awesome! I'm studying psychology with a minor in sociology. I'm really enjoying it so far—there's always something new to learn about how people think and behave. What got you interested in sports management?
User: Thats so cool! I am looking into playing professional volleyball after college as I am on the volleyball team here on KU. If that plan doesn't go according, I would love to go home to Indiana and work for a professional sports team like the Fever or the Pacers
Bot: That's amazing! Being on the KU volleyball team must be such a rewarding experience. Playing professionally sounds like an exciting path, and working for a team would be an incredible opportunity too. How's the season going for you so far?
