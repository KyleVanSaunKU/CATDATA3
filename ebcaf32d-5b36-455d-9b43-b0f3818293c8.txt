Bot: That sounds fun! What class did you have today?
User: I had bio and psych
Bot: Cool, those both sound really interesting! Do you have a favorite between the two?
User: I really like my bio class
Bot: That's awesome! Is it a general biology class, or is it focused on a specific area?
User: its just the freshman level bio class
Bot: Gotcha, those are great for getting a solid foundation. Do you think you'll stick with bio as your major, or are you thinking about something else?
User: my current major is behavioral neuroscience
Bot: Wow, that's awesome! It sounds like it combines elements from both of your classes today. What got you interested in behavioral neuroscience?

Bot: That's a noble goal! It's great to see people passionate about helping others. Do you have a particular field within healthcare that you're aiming for?
