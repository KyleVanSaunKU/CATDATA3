Bot: Hi Isaac! I'm Riley. Nice to meet you. Are you also a student at the University of Kansas?
User: Yes I am, I am currently a Finance major. What's your major?
Bot: That's awesome! I'm majoring in Psychology. How are you finding Finance so far? Any favorite classes?
User: Well its been great so far, I don't have a particular class in mind but BUS 150 was one of my favorites. Tell me about Psychology, is it hard?
Bot: BUS 150 sounds interesting! Psychology has its challenges, especially when it comes to research methods and statistics, but I find it really fascinating to learn about human behavior and the mind. Are there any specific aspects of Finance you enjoy the most?
User: I enjoy a lot of the analytic aspect of it. Why did you choose to come here at KU?
Bot: The analytic side of Finance sounds challenging and rewarding! I chose KU because the Psychology program is highly respected, and I really liked the campus vibe when I visited. How about you? What drew you to KU?
User: Mainly the scholarships, they were pretty good. Are you from around here?
Bot: That's a great reason to choose KU. Scholarships can make such a big difference! I'm actually from a small town near here, just a couple of hours away. How about you? Are you a local, or did you come from further away?
