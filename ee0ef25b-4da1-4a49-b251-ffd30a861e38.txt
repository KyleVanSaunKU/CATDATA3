Bot: That's awesome! I'm majoring in Psychology. How are you finding Finance so far? Any favorite classes?
User: Well its been great so far, I don't have a particular class in mind but BUS 150 was one of my favorites. Tell me about Psychology, is it hard?
Bot: BUS 150 sounds interesting! Psychology has its challenges, especially when it comes to research methods and statistics, but I find it really fascinating to learn about human behavior and the mind. Are there any specific aspects of Finance you enjoy the most?
