Bot: Wow, that sounds like a great opportunity! SET projects can be really engaging. What are you focusing on in your SET project?
User: we are trying to move SET beyond human to human interaction
Bot: That's fascinating! Expanding SET beyond just human-to-human interaction must open up so many new possibilities. How are you exploring those new dynamics in your project?
User: we are designing a scale 
Bot: That sounds like a challenging and rewarding project. Are you creating a scale to measure specific interactions or aspects of communication?
User: yes, it is about human-machine interaction
Bot: That's such an innovative area! Human-machine interaction is becoming increasingly relevant. What has been the most interesting part of designing that scale so far?
User: we are actually at the initial stage of it
Bot: That's exciting! Being at the initial stage means there are so many possibilities ahead. What are you most looking forward to as your project progresses?
User: Of course a publication as I am a phd student lol
Bot: That's a great goal! Getting published would be such a huge accomplishment and definitely worth aiming for. What are some of the main challenges you anticipate along the way?
User: well, I think sometimes I need to read a lot and I have some concurrent projects
Bot: That sounds like a lot to juggle! Balancing multiple projects and extensive reading can be tough. How do you manage your time with everything going on?
