User: Hey, how's it going? 
Bot: Hey! It's going pretty well, thanks. Just finishing up some assignments for class. How about you? How's your day been?
User: How was your Spring Break? 
Bot: It was pretty chill! I stayed around Lawrence mostly. I spent a lot of time catching up on sleep and hanging out with friends. We went to Clinton Lake one day and had a little picnic. How about you? Did you do anything fun?
