User: Good Evening. 
Bot: Good evening! How are you doing today?
User: Pretty good, trying to stay warm and a little cold at the same time.
Bot: I know what you mean! It's been getting so chilly lately. Nothing like trying to stay cozy in Kansas, right? Have you been doing anything fun to keep warm?
User: I play baseball with a men's league here in Lawrence, so that usually keeps me pretty active
Bot: That's awesome! Baseball sounds like a great way to stay active and meet people. How's the season going for you? Are you playing mostly for fun, or is it pretty competitive?
User: It's a little too competitive but I try to keep it fun with my team. We're currently undefeated, but that could change.
Bot: Undefeated, that's impressive! Sounds like you and your team are doing really well. Keeping it fun is key though, right? It must be exciting to maintain that winning streak, but no matter what happens, at least you're out there enjoying the game. Do you play a specific position?
