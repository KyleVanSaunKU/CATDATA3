User: Good, where are you from?
Bot: I'm originally from Kansas City. It's nice being somewhat close to home while I'm studying here at KU. How about you, where are you from?
User: I am from Kansas City as well
Bot: That's awesome! What part of Kansas City are you from? I'm on the Kansas side. Do you go back often?
User: I am from the Kansas side as well. I go back weekly. What is your major?
Bot: That's cool, maybe we've crossed paths and didn't even know it! I'm majoring in psychology. It's really intriguing to learn about human behavior and mental processes. What about you? What are you majoring in?
User: I am majoring in finance. Where do you want to live after college and what job do you want
Bot: Finance sounds really practical, that's great! As for after college, I'm considering staying in the Midwest, maybe somewhere like Chicago, where there are lots of opportunities in psychology-related fields. It would be cool to work as a clinical psychologist or perhaps in research. How about you? Do you have any plans or dream jobs after graduation?
User: I am working in wholesale insurance and living in Kansas City
Bot: That sounds really solid! Staying in Kansas City can be great, especially if you enjoy the area and have built connections there. How did you get into working in wholesale insurance? It seems like a really interesting field with lots of potentials.
User: I took course work in it and got to like it. How did you get into psycology
Bot: That's awesome that you found a path you enjoy through coursework! For me, my interest in psychology started in high school when I took an introductory course. I was really fascinated by how the mind works and why people behave the way they do. It just kind of clicked with me, so I decided to pursue it further in college. Did you have a specific class or moment that made you want to go into finance or insurance?
User: Yes, in my finance 408 work. What year in school are you
Bot: Finance 408 must have been pretty impactful for you! I'm currently a junior, so it's an interesting time trying to balance coursework with thinking about what's next after graduation. Are you in your junior year as well or a different year?
